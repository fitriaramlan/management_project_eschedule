# management_project_eschedule
This undergraduate project proposed a project management platform that was aimed to manage the development time in new projects and ongoing projects, especially for software development industries. The platform was designed by the principle of waterfall model where project activities were broken down into linear sequential phases in which each step depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks. The overall software development work can be categorized into phases such as initial design analysis, system design, code development, software testing, and maintenance work. The motivation to develop this platform was influenced by the real-life experience of working in a web development company, where the project manager needed to keep track of the development process and time of multiple software development projects.
